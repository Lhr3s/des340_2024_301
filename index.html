    <h1>One Pager Design</h1>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
    Check your slides. They can not be shorter than a screen, but longer. If you have more than 5 blocks on a slide, that is two slides.
    Check call to action button. There is only one action we have, and good if the button is always visible.
    Is the images big enough? (Big is good)

    <h2>How to do that?</h2>
    <p>Have subtitles for each (one or two) paragraphs?
    Check your font size. Check it in prototype view, compare it for real websites.
    Is there line height big enough?
    Is there margin around of your text?</p>
    Is difference between subtitle and bread text? (Different font family, different size, color, style)
    If you have font pairing: Are the two fonts really different?

    <p>Here are some guidelines:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Is contrast is big enough between background and text? (Double check text on images)</li>
    <li>Check your colors. They have to be identical. (Use styles)</li>
    <li>How many colors did you use? (Keep the list as short as possible, if you have meaningful colors in content, consider grayscale or black & white)</li>
    <li>Use clean colors (from the top and the right edge of the color cube).</li>
    <li>Check your margins. Keep margins for text all the time. Margins, line heights and spaces after paragraphs, subtitles supposed to be in ratio.)</li>
    <li>Check your prototype view. (If something is missing from prototype view, that is not inside of the frame.)</li>
    </ol>
